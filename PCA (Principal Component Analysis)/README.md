# Healthcare Data Analysis using PCA

## Overview
This interactive web application demonstrates the power of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in healthcare data analytics. It helps healthcare professionals, data analysts, and researchers understand complex patterns in patient health metrics without getting overwhelmed by the high-dimensional nature of medical data.

## What is PCA and Why Use It in Healthcare?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique that helps:
- Reduce complex medical data to its most important patterns
- Identify which health metrics tend to vary together
- Spot unusual patient cases or groups of similar patients
- Simplify complex healthcare data while keeping the important information

## For Healthcare Professionals
This tool helps you:
- Discover hidden patterns in your patient data
- Identify which health metrics are most important
- Group similar patients together
- Find unusual cases that might need special attention
- Make data-driven healthcare decisions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your computer
- Basic familiarity with running commands in a terminal/command prompt

### Installation Steps
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "path/to/PCA (Principal Component Analysis)"
   ```
4. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch the application:
   ```
   streamlit run pca_healthcare_app.py
   ```

## Using the Application

### 1. Data Overview Section
- View the raw patient health data
- Understand the basic statistics of each health metric
- Get familiar with the available health measurements

### 2. PCA Analysis Section
#### Scree Plot
- Shows how much information each principal component captures
- Helps determine how many components to keep
- Higher bars mean more important components

#### Cumulative Variance Plot
- Shows how much total information is captured
- Helps decide how many components are needed
- Usually look for 80-90% total variance explained

### 3. Interactive Visualizations
#### PCA Components Heatmap
- Blue/Red colors show relationships between metrics
- Darker colors mean stronger relationships
- Help identify which health metrics vary together

#### 2D Patient Distribution
- Each point represents a patient
- Similar patients appear closer together
- Outliers might need special attention
- Hover over points to see patient details

### 4. Feature Contributions
- Bar charts show which health metrics matter most
- Longer bars mean more important metrics
- Helps prioritize which measurements to focus on

### 5. Key Insights
- Automatically generated insights about your data
- Highlights the most important patterns found
- Suggests areas for further investigation

## Understanding the Health Metrics

The application analyzes these key health indicators:
1. **Age**: Patient's age in years
2. **BMI**: Body Mass Index - measures body fat based on height and weight
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure measurement
4. **Cholesterol**: Total cholesterol level
5. **Blood Sugar**: Blood glucose level
6. **Heart Rate**: Resting heart rate in beats per minute
7. **Exercise Hours**: Weekly exercise hours
8. **Sleep Hours**: Average daily sleep hours
9. **Stress Level**: Stress score (1-10 scale)

## Tips for Best Results
1. Start with the Data Overview to understand your data
2. Pay attention to the Scree Plot to understand data complexity
3. Use the interactive features - hover, zoom, and pan on graphs
4. Look for clusters of similar patients in the 2D visualization
5. Use the Feature Contributions to identify key health metrics
